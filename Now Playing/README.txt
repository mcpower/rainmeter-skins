A skin to show a taskbar-sized (40px high) display of what is currently playing in your music player.

Currently, it is set to CAD which I use for foobar2000. There are two versions: Left Text and Right Text. Left Text has not been updated in a while, while Right Text has. You can probably port some stuff over from Right Text to Left Text.
